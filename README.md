# Coordinated-Control-Strategy-for-Industrial-Load-Frequency-Regulation-Based-on-PSO

Overview
The project addresses one of the critical challenges in modern power systems: maintaining frequency stability in the face of increasing renewable energy penetration and growing electricity demand. As conventional generator units struggle with rapid ramping and renewable sources introduce intermittent fluctuations, the need for more responsive and cost-effective frequency regulation becomes paramount. In this context, the research explores how high energy-consuming industrial loads—specifically aluminum electrolysis loads and electric boilers—can be effectively harnessed for load frequency control (LFC).
